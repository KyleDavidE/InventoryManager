These action figures are usually marketed toward boys and adult collectors.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued that action figures which represent traditional masculine traits and are closely associated with the public sphere are particularly popular with boys.[1] While most commonly marketed as a children\'s toy, the action figure has gained wide acceptance as an adult collector item.[2] In such a case, the item may be produced and designed on the assumption it will be bought solely for display.','red'),(2,'2016-05-08 12:42:04','2016-05-08 19:44:26','Animals','Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa).

Dolls have traditionally been used in magic and religious rituals throughout the world, and traditional dolls made of materials such as clay and wood are found in the Americas, Asia, Africa and Europe. The earliest documented dolls go back to the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece and Rome. The use of dolls as toys was documented in Greece around 100 AD. They have been made as crude, rudimentary playthings as well as elaborate art. Modern doll manufacturing has its roots in Germany, going back to the 15th century. With industrialization and new materials such as porcelain and plastic, dolls were increasingly mass-produced. During the 20th century, dolls became increasingly popular as collectibles.','teal'),(7,'2016-05-08 12:42:06','2016-05-08 19:48:58','Educational toys','Toys may be used for a number of educational purposes. Some toys have incidental educational value, while others are known specifically by the moniker of \"educational toys.\" Educational toys are typically built for and used by young children. One could make the argument that an educational toy is actually any toy. Most children are constantly interacting with and learning about the world. This definition is ultimately too broad because one could make the same argument about a rock or a stick as it is not uncommon to see a child play with almost anything nearby.','purple'),(8,'2016-05-08 12:42:06','2016-05-08 19:51:40','Electronic toys','A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.\r\n\r\nConventionally, a computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU), and some form of memory. The processing element carries out arithmetic and logic operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information. Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source, and the result of operations saved and retrieved.','amber'),(9,'2016-05-08 12:42:06','2016-05-08 19:52:03','Executive toys','Executive toys, also called office toys, are small toys or items that are commonly owned by executives and other office workers for the purpose of stimulating creativity, relieving stress, and providing pleasure[1]. Initially, research into the benefits of toys focused on the pleasure, mental and physical development of children, which led to a lack of understanding about the benefits of adults owning andusing these toys in the workplace. Nowadays, office toys have been treated as an important role in employer management in many companies. Beyond pure function, office toys help decorate an employer\'s personal working area and could lead office workers to relieve stress by playing with them. One of the classic office toys is Newton\'s cradle.','deep-purple'),(10,'2016-05-08 12:42:07','2016-05-08 19:53:34','Food-related toys','Food is any substance [1] consumed to provide nutritional support for the body.

However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).','light-green'),(12,'2016-05-08 12:42:07','2016-05-08 20:05:35','Model building','Model building as a hobby involves the creation of models either from kits or from materials and components acquired by the builder.','pink'),(13,'2016-05-08 12:42:07','2016-05-08 20:06:13','Physical activity and dexterity','Physical exercise is any bodily activity that enhances or maintains physical fitness and overall health and wellness. It is performed for various reasons, including increasing growth and development, preventing aging, strengthening muscles and the cardiovascular system, honing athletic skills, weight loss or maintenance, and merely enjoyment. Frequent and regular physical exercise boosts the immune system and helps prevent \"diseases of affluence\" such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.[1][2] It may also help prevent stress and depression, increase quality of sleep and act as a non-pharmaceutical sleep aid to treat diseases such as insomnia, help promote or maintain positive self-esteem, improve mental health, maintain steady digestion and treat constipation and gas, regulate fertility health, and augment an individual\'s sex appeal or body image, which has been found to be linked with higher levels of self-esteem.[3][4] Childhood obesity is a growing global concern,[5] and physical exercise may help decrease some of the effects of childhood and adult obesity. Some care providers call exercise the \"miracle\" or \"wonder\" drug—alluding to the wide variety of benefits that it can provide for many individuals.[6][7]','brown'),(14,'2016-05-08 12:42:08','2016-05-08 20:07:21','Puzzle/assembly','A puzzle is a game, problem, or toy that tests a person\'s ingenuity or knowledge.
